o Version 1.5 02/27/2019
    MFUSG -- Updated program version and date.
    GLO2BASU1 -- DDREFERENCE was not implemented correctly and so the drawdown
       reference array was never reset when DDREFERENCE was specified in the
       output control file.
    GWF2BASU1 -- Fixed DDREFERENCE bug.
    GWF2BCF-LPF-U1 -- Fixed horizontal anisotropy rotation equation.
    GWF2EVT8U1 -- Adding missing variable to use statement.
    GWF2WEL7U1 -- Initialized variable to zero.
    UTL7U1 -- Modified UBDSVBU to use correct node number.
    Executables -- Compiled using Intel Fortran 2019.2.190


o Version 1.4 10/27/2017
    MFUSG -- Updated program version and date.  Added calls for the
       ETS and DRT Packages.  Revised the way flow terms are written 
       to the budget file for CLN.
    GLO2BASU1 -- Added JA symmetry check.  Program now terminates
       with an error if the user-provided JA is not symmetric.
    GWF2BCF-LPF-U1 -- Removed the minimum saturation value.  Difficult
       problems behave better by allowing saturation to go to zero
       and letting the solver handle it. Revised the way CLN-GW flows 
       are written to the budget file.
    GWF2ETS8U1 -- This is the Segmented Evapotranspiration Package
       added in this release.
    GWF2DRT8U1 -- This is the Drain with Return Flow Package added
       in this release.
    GWF2WEL7U1 -- Revised the way flow terms are written to the
       budget file for CLN.
    GWF2DRN7U1 -- Revised the way flow terms are written to the
       budget file for CLN.
    GWF2RIV7U1 -- Revised the way flow terms are written to the
       budget file for CLN.
    GWF2GHB7U1 -- Revised the way flow terms are written to the
       budget file for CLN.
    GWF2FHB7U1 -- Revised the way flow terms are written to the
       budget file for CLN.
    GWF2LAK7U1 -- Added ability to read bathymetry and stage/volume
       tables.
    GWF2SFR7U1 -- Corrected an error in saving stream flows to
       a compact budget file.
    GWF2SUB7U1 -- Corrected errors in the unstructured subsidence
       formulation and output.
    CLN2BASU1 -- Removed the minimum saturation value. Revised the
       way GW-CLN flow terms are written to the CLN budget file.
    GLO2SMS-U1 -- Modified the way constant head and inactive cells
       are handled at the matrix level.  In the present version,
       these cells are handled by inserting a 1.0 on the diagonal,
       zeroing out the off-diagonal terms, and putting the head
       value on the right-hand side.
    UTL7U1 -- Added two new subroutines for writing flow terms
       to budget files.
    PARUTL7 -- Corrected an error that caused list-based parameter
       to work incorrectly for structured grids.
    GMODULES -- Added a placedholder variable (IATS) that is not
       used by the program.
    ZONBUDUSG -- Updated to version 1.01.  A bug could be
       encountered with non-compact budget files, output in the
       CSV format, and a changing number of budget types in the
       budget file.  The program now terminates with an error
       if this condition is encountered and recommends use of the
       COMPACT BUDGET format.
    Executables -- Compiled using Intel Fortran 2017.4.210. 


o Version 1.3 12/01/2015
    GLO2BASU1 -- Added DDREFERENCE option so that the reference head
       used to calculate drawdown can change during the simulation.
    GWF2BASU1 -- Removed calls to u1drel8 and replaced with calls to
       generalized u1drel array reader.  Time information was being
       written to the listing file more frequently than necessary
       for an unstructured simulation.  This was corrected to be
       consistent with MODFLOW-2005.
    GWF2BCF-LPF-U1 -- Fixed a problem with BCF input that occured 
       when LAYCON was assigned a value of 2.
    GLO2SMSU1 -- Modifed approach for handling matrix terms for
       rows with IBOUND <= 0.
    DISU2GNCN1 -- In BD routines changed AMAT to AMATFL to allow 
       for new approach for handling IBOUND <= 0.  
    GWF2HFBU1 -- Implemented IVC=1 for vertically staggered staggered 
       grids.
    GWF2WELU1 -- Fixed issue for case where wells were assigned to
       CLN nodes and structured GWF nodes.
    GWF2GHB7U1 -- Changed call to ULSTRDU so that CLN nodes can be
       specified.

       specified.

       specified.  Fixed bug related parameters.
    GWF2CHD7U1 -- Changed call to ULSTRDU so that CLN nodes can be
       specified.
    GWF2EVT8U1 -- For unstructured grids, the node number written
       to the binary budget file may have been incorrect in some
       cases.
    GWF2RCH8U1 -- For unstructured grids, the node number written
       to the binary budget file may have been incorrect in some
       cases.
    GWF2FHB7U1 -- Fixed a bug in the writing of FHB flows to the
       binary budget file.
    GWF2SFR7U1 -- Fixed several issues related to streams in dry
       cells and streams in models with only a single layer.
    CLN2BASU1 -- Minor changes to unit number handling and filling
       of arrays. Fixed bug in assigning conduit node number.  Fixed
       bug in calculation of conduit height. Fixed bug in saving
       of CLN IBOUND to binary file.
    PCGU7 -- Added several variable initialization statements.
    XMDLIB_2 -- Added some additional write statements for MUTPCG=0.
    UTL7U1 -- Removed u1drel8.  Generalized u1drel so that it can
       read binary files in the same manner as u2drel.
    Example problems -- Made a few minor changes to several of the 
       input files.  The results from the simulations are the same, 
       but, the appearance of some output files is slightly different.
    Executables -- Compiled using Intel Fortran 16.0.0.110 
       Build 20150815

       constant-head budget terms are tabulated.
    DISU2GNCB1 -- Minor source formatting changes.
    DISU2GNCN1 -- Devised new approach for expanding the system of 
       equations to include ghost-node connections.  New method should 
       be substantially faster for problems with many ghost nodes. Fixed
       case where ghost-node contributing cell starts or becomes inactive.
    GLO2SMS-U1 -- Added support for PCGU bgcs option.
    GMODULES -- Renamed TMPA variable to FLOWJA and fixed an

       Constant-head flows are now calculated from FLOWJA array instead
       of being recalculated.  Constant-head flows are tabulated by cell
       face instead of by cell to provide a more accurate budget.
    GWF2GHB7U1 -- Fixed the NOPRINT option.
    GWF2LAK7U1 -- Fixed several bugs related to lakes and their use with
