NAME
     modflow-usg - Modular unstructured three-dimensional finite-
               difference ground-water model

ABSTRACT
     A new version of MODFLOW, called MODFLOW–USG (for UnStructured 
     Grid), was developed to support a wide variety of structured and 
     unstructured grid types, including nested grids and grids based on 
     prismatic triangles, rectangles, hexagons, and other cell shapes. 
     Flexibility in grid design can be used to focus resolution along 
     rivers and around wells, for example, or to subdiscretize 
     individual layers to better represent hydrostratigraphic units. 
     MODFLOW–USG is based on an underlying control volume finite 
     difference (CVFD) formulation in which a cell can be connected to 
     an arbitrary number of adjacent cells. To improve accuracy of the 
     CVFD formulation for irregular grid-cell geometries or nested 
     grids, a generalized Ghost Node Correction (GNC) Package was 
     developed, which uses interpolated heads in the flow calculation 
     between adjacent connected cells. MODFLOW–USG includes a 
     Groundwater Flow (GWF) Process, based on the GWF Process in 
     MODFLOW–2005, as well as a new Connected Linear Network (CLN) 
     Process to simulate the effects of multi-node wells, karst 
     conduits, and tile drains, for example. The CLN Process is tightly 
     coupled with the GWF Process in that the equations from both 
     processes are formulated into one matrix equation and solved 
     simultaneously. This robustness results from using an unstructured 
     grid with unstructured matrix storage and solution schemes. 
     MODFLOW–USG also contains an optional Newton-Raphson formulation, 
     based on the formulation in MODFLOW–NWT, for improving solution 
     convergence and avoiding problems with the drying and rewetting of 
     cells. Because the existing MODFLOW solvers were developed for 
     structured and symmetric matrices, they were replaced with a new 
     Sparse Matrix Solver (SMS) Package developed specifically for 
     MODFLOW–USG. The SMS Package provides several methods for resolving 
     nonlinearities and multiple symmetric and asymmetric linear 
     solution schemes to solve the matrix arising from the flow 
     equations and the Newton-Raphson formulation, respectively.


METHOD
     The ground-water flow equation is solved using the finite-difference
     approximation.  The flow region is subdivided into blocks in which
     the medium properties are assumed to be uniform.  In plan view the
     blocks are made from a grid of mutually perpendicular lines that may
     be variably spaced.  Model layers can have varying thickness.  A 
     flow equation is written for each block, called a cell.  A sparse 
     matrix solver is provided for solving the resulting matrix problem; 
     the user can choose the best solver for the particular problem.  
     Flow-rate and cumulative-volume balances from each type of inflow 
     and outflow are computed for each time step.


HISTORY

      MODFLOW-USG Version 1.00.00 05/03/2013 -- First release.


DATA REQUIREMENTS
     In order to use MODFLOW-USG, initial conditions, hydraulic 
     properties, and stresses must be specified for every model cell in 
     the finite- difference grid. Input data are read from files.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
     MODFLOW-USG is written in Fortran 90 with some Fortran 2003 
     extensions. The code has been used on personal computers running 
     various forms of the Microsoft Windows operating system.
